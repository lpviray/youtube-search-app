# youtube-search-app
This is an interactive YouTube homepage clone based on YouTube's 2023 dark mode UI design. The goal of the project was to demonstrate the ability to request data from a real API and render it onto a webpage. Visitors of the website can type in whatever keyword(s)/phrase they want in the search bar and load in up to 10 relevant videos. Entering in nothing will generate random videos instead. This project is still a work in progress.<br/>

The live webpage can be viewed at: [https://lpviray.github.io/youtube-search-app/](https://lpviray.github.io/youtube-search-app/)
